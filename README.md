# DeathWhispers
A spigot plugin that, whenever you die, whispers to you the coordinates you were at when you died.
You can click the whispered message to copy the coordinates it displays to your chat input thing.


All displayed messages can be changed in the config file. You can enable/disable logging these messages too!


Compatible with 1.15+ (perhaps it'd work with older versions too, but I'm not too familiar with the API and really not willing to try every version until something breaks). If you need support for older versions, you can try changing the used version in the 'plugin.yml' file before compiling this plugin, it'll probably work.
